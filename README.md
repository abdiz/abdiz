<h1> Hey, there.ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

<h2>Backend developer | software engineer</h2>
<br>
I love designing systems and diving deep into challenges to solve problems. I have more than 5 years of experience in web applications. Recently working with PHP & python language.
I have experience in phases of the software development life cycle which include Design, Development, Business Analysis/Modeling, and Maintain.  
Tdd is something I recently went to.
